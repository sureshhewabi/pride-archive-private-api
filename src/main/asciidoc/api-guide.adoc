== Filtering Help
Some of the API endpoints support filtering to narrow the search results. There are two types of filters available - 'filter' and 'advanced filter'.
The below examples help in understanding the different options supported by these filters and how they can be chained together to perform queries.

=== Filter

This type of filter supports conditions in the following format:
 `field==value`
It also allows to chain the conditions to form queries as shown below:
`field1==value,field2==value`
If field is of date type value should be in format `yyyy-MM-dd`

[discrete]
==== Example 1

A simple query can be submited in this format.
[source]
countries==Germany

Multiple values can be sent and an `OR` condition applies on these words
[source]
countries==Germany China

[discrete]
==== Example 2

A date field can be queried by sending two parameters. A date in the format of `yyyy-MM-dd` and a value to the dateGap in following formats:
`+1DAY`,`+1MONTH`,`+1YEAR`
[source]
submission_date==2013-10-20

[discrete]
==== Example 3

Multiple conditions can be chained together, delimited by comma
[source]
submission_date==2013-10-20,countries==Germany China

=== Advance Filter

This type of filter supports different options like using a regular expression for matching, providing a date range and using in condition to supply multiple values.

[discrete]
==== Example 1
A simple query is of the form `field==value`
[source]
accession==PXF00000491725

[discrete]
==== Example 2
The filter can be supplied with fields nested inside the json structure as well. The files API response has a `fileCategory` object and a `value` field within it.
This can be used as a query field to fetch values as shown below.
[source]
fileCategory.value==RESULT

[discrete]
==== Example 3
A regex can be used for pattern matching and supplying complex queries. The below example filters for files which contain the word `mzid` in the name.
[source]
fileName=regex=mzid

[discrete]
==== Example 4
A date range can be supplied while querying date fields in the below format.
[source]
publicationDate=range=[2006-01-01 TO 2015-12-31]

[discrete]
==== Example 5
An `in` predicate can be used to supply multiple values to a field and it works like an `OR` condition.
[source]
accession=in=PXF00000491725|PXF00000000014

[discrete]
==== Example 6
Multiple conditions can be supplied by seperating with comma.
[source]
fileCategory.value==RESULT,publicationDate=range=[2006-01-01 TO 2015-12-31]


== Appendix

[[appendix-http-verbs]]
=== HTTP verbs

RESTful notes tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP verbs.

|===
| Verb | Usage

| `GET`
| Used to retrieve a resource

| `POST`
| Used to create a new resource

| `PATCH`
| Used to update an existing resource, including partial updates

| `DELETE`
| Used to delete an existing resource
|===

RESTful notes tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP status codes.

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| The request completed successfully

| `201 Created`
| A new resource has been created successfully. The resource's URI is available from the response's
`Location` header

| `204 No Content`
| An update to an existing resource has been applied successfully

| `400 Bad Request`
| The request was malformed. The response body will include an error providing further information

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource did not exist
|===

=== Hypermedia

RESTful Notes uses hypermedia and resources include links to other resources in their
responses. Responses are in http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[Hypertext Application
from resource to resource.
Language (HAL)] format. Links can be found beneath the `_links` key. Users of the API should
not create URIs themselves, instead they should use the above-described links to navigate
